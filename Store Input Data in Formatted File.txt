/*
Instructions
Suppose that the file inData.txt, data set 1, contains the following data:

Giselle Robinson Accounting
5600 5 30
450 9
75 1.5
The first line contains a personâ€™s first name, last name, and the department the person works in.

In the second line, the first number represents the monthly gross salary, the bonus (as a percent), and the taxes (as a percent).

The third line contains the distance traveled and the traveling time.

The fourth line contains the number of coffee cups sold and the cost of each coffee cup.

Write statements so that after the program executes, the contents of the file outData.txt are as shown below. If necessary, declare additional variables. Your statements should be general enough so that if the content of the input file changes and the program is run again (without editing and recompiling), it outputs the appropriate results.
